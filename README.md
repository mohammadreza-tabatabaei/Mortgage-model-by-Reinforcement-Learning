# 🏦 Reinforcement Learning for Mortgage Loan Approval  

## 📌 Overview  
This project applies **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** to optimize **mortgage loan approval decisions**. The goal is to train an **AI agent** that balances **profitability and risk** by learning from past experiences in a simulated environment.  

The model considers the following **factors**:  
- **LTV (Loan-to-Value Ratio)**  
- **Customer Income**  
- **Credit Score**  
- **Repayment Trends**  

The agent makes **three decisions**:  
1. **Deny Loan**  
2. **Approve with Low Interest Rate**  
3. **Approve with High Interest Rate**  

## 🎯 Features  
✅ **Deep Reinforcement Learning** using **DQN (Deep Q-Network)**  
✅ **Dynamic Mortgage Environment** simulating real-world financial factors  
✅ **Risk vs. Profit Optimization** using a **custom reward function**  
✅ **Visualization** of rewards, action distribution, and agent performance  
✅ **Fully Modular & Extensible** with separate components for environment, agent, and execution
